# Translator App 3000

## Description

Welcome to Group 1a's project.  See your words transformed into Arabic, Spanish, Hmong, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Korean, and Minion with the TRANSLATOR APP 3000. This app/website was built as a fun project to test our developer (developing) skills and for you to use to translate your English words into another language. 

With the App, users can effortlessly enter in text (in English) and convert it to one of the preselected languages. This is a great way to pass a few moments or a few hours to amuse yourself.  We hope you enjoy!
